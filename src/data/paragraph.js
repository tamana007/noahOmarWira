He turned our two into three, filling our home with love, joy, and barakah","from the very first moment, he brought light, peace, and joy to our hearts. He transformed our little family into something more complete, filling our days with laughter, hope, and endless love. His presence is a reminder of Allah’s mercy and a source of barakah in our home. With every smile and every little movement, he makes our world more meaningful and our hearts more grateful","When little Noah looks up at us with his wide, innocent eyes, it feels as though the whole world pauses in that moment. His gaze carries a softness that melts every worry and replaces it with pure love. In those tiny eyes, we see trust, wonder, and the reflection of all the dreams we hold for him. The way he studies our faces, as if we are his whole universe, reminds us that nothing is more precious than being his parents.","Seven Months of Precious Memories At seven months, one of the funniest memories was in the park with his dad and me. His sense of entitlement for having cake and grabbing it all by himself had us both laughing out loud. He sat there with determination in his little eyes, trying to hold on tight to every bite, as if it was all his. Between the fresh air, his playful giggles, and the joy he brought to us that day, it became one of those simple yet unforgettable family moment","We are passionate about what he is bringing into our lives—every smile, every tiny step, every new discovery fills our hearts with joy. His presence reminds us of hope, growth, and endless love. With him, our world feels brighter, fuller, and beautifully complete. Truly, he is our greatest blessing","We want our baby to never feel even the tiniest disappointment in his life, nor sense that anything is missing from his heart. Our greatest hope is that he grows surrounded by love, guided by kindness, and blessed with opportunities that help him shine. His happiness and fulfillment will always be our greatest purpose","Every moment with him is a reminder of the beauty of life and the power of love. We pray he grows with courage to follow his dreams, strength to overcome challenges, and a heart that always feels safe, cherished, and complete in our care","final one wishes"]

      "A sweet day with love, laughter, and cake became one of the highlights of Noah’s early months. We sat in the park, the sun shining gently, as he discovered the world in his own playful way. His tiny giggles echoed louder than the breeze, filling the space with joy, That day, Noah reached out with his little hands, determined to grab his piece of cake and hold it tight as if it belonged only to him. His seriousness in that moment made us laugh endlessly, but it also reminded us how quickly he was growing—learning, exploring, and claiming the world around him,Every crumb on his cheeks, every sparkle in his eyes, and every sound of laughter made that simple day unforgettable. It was more than just a family outing; it was a memory woven with love, a reminder of how precious these early years are"
